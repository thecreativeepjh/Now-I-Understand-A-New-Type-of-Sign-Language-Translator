Now I Understand
A New Type of Sign Language Translator
Ezra Huska

Abstract
357 000, that is the estimated number of deaf Canadians. Also, there is a shortage of sign language translators/interpreters. This means many people are unable to communicate properly with others, since sign language is many peoples only language. These people can feel isolated and due to isolation, have a higher risk of mental health issues. In order to help solve these challenges, I worked to create a digital sign language translator. While others have attempted the challenge of making a sign language translator in the past, I made 2 major improvements over them. The use of face detection and the detection and translation of words (full, moving signs). With a combined approach, using Machine learning and specifically purpose Neural Networks. In practice it is able to translate sentences from ASL into English, allowing me to create a translator and an assistant. While still in the early stages of development this project has the potential to help thousands of people in Canada and millions around the world.
